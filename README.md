Password Generator Project

In this project we were tasked to create an application that an employee could use to generate a safe random password. The application asks for criteia such as the length of the password for example. This application also will run in the browser and feature dynamic updated HTML and CSS.

JavaScript is used to power the functionality of the application, such as prompting user input and generating a random password.
